Introduction to Linux

## History

Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.  
The name Linux comes from Linus + Unix.

## What is UNIX?

UNIX is a powerful, multi-user, multitasking operating system originally developed in the 1970s at **AT&T's Bell Labs**.  
It serves as the foundation for many modern operating systems.

## Is Linux an Operating System?

Strictly speaking, Linux itself is not a complete operating system.

Linux is an open-source kernel.  
A complete operating system is formed when the Linux kernel is combined with:
1.System libraries  
2.Core utilities  
3.Package manager  
4.Desktop/server tools  

This complete system is called a Linux Distribution (Distro).

## What is a Kernel?

The kernel is the core part of an operating system that:

1.Manages CPU, memory, and devices  
2.Handles communication between hardware and software  
3.Controls process scheduling and system calls  

## Key Features of Linux

1. Open source and highly customizable  
2. Secure and frequently updated  
3. Supports multi-user access  
4. Supports multitasking  
5. Runs on a wide variety of hardware platforms  

## What is a Linux Distribution?

A Linux Distribution (Distro) is a complete operating system built using:

1.Linux kernel  
2.Package management system  
3.System tools and applications  

Examples:
1.Ubuntu  
2.RHEL  
3.CentOS  
4.Kali Linux  
5.Fedora  

## Major Linux Distribution Families

1. Debian Family

Stable, community-driven, and widely used in cloud and DevOps.

Examples:
1.Ubuntu – Popular for DevOps and cloud  
2.Linux Mint – Beginner-friendly  

Common:
1. Package manager: `apt`  
2. Package type: `.deb`  

Most commonly used family in DevOps

2. RHEL Family (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)

Enterprise-focused and widely used in production servers.

Examples:
1.RHEL – Paid enterprise OS  
2.Fedora – Upstream testing and latest features  
3.CentOS Stream – Rolling upstream of RHEL  
4.Oracle Linux – RHEL-compatible with Oracle support  

Common:
1.Package manager: `yum` / `dnf`  
2.Package type: `.rpm`  

Very important for production servers

3. SUSE Family

Widely used in European enterprises.

Examples:
1.SLES (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server) – Paid enterprise version  
2.OpenSUSE – Community version  
  i.Leap – Stable release  
  ii.Tumbleweed – Rolling release  

Common:
1.Package manager: `zypper`  
2.Package type: `.rpm`  

## Summary

1.Linux Kernel – Core component that manages hardware and system resources  
2.Distribution Families – Groups of distros sharing a common base  
3.Linux Distributions – Complete operating systems built on the Linux kernel
